# Kaggle-TFI-Revenue

Contains the two train/test data sets as well as two R code files.  

- __DB.r__ is the davies-bouldin index for K-Means clustering evaluation metric, provided by Shirley Mills.  
- __TFI-Kevin.rmd__ is the R markdown for all the code for this competition.  Don't be fooled by the R markdown extension,
it's pretty messy and not much commenting going on..
